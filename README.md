# ZipcodeAPI ll


Project 2: Distance between Zips

In this project we will allow the user to provide us two zip codes and we will display the distance between the 2 zip codes.

To get started run the following commands

create-react-app zip-distance
cd zip-distance
npm start
At this point you should see the React hello world page running on your browser. You should leave it running in the background while you work on this project.

Now open this folder (zip-distance) in your text editor. You will see all of the code the create-react-app setup for us. Since this is the stock project we can begin editing the files as we see fit. You can start at App.js and you can also edit public/index.html (to add Bootstrap for example).

Using the same API as project 1, we will build a zip-distance app, where given two zip codes, we will calculate the distance between the two zip codes.

Primary Tasks

Using the same zip-api we used in project 1:

Implement a distance calculator
it should allow US zip codes only
Display distance in a given metric
Stretch Features (Optional, but highly recommended)

Keep a history of recent searches
Let user choose between which measurement they want the output in(either miles or kilometers)
Note: these will require additional fetch call to the API. Feel free to use your own CSS styles and to add any additional features you want.
